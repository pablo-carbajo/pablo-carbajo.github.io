        <p>Hi! My name is Pablo Carbajo Derennes.</p>
        <p> 
            I am currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Data Science and Economics. Some of my current passions include learning about Blockchain technology and De-Fi turning into an intent-centric technology. I am also passionate about the markets and how different mathematical tools can be used to better interpret the market.             
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. Currently, I enjoy playing and watching soccer (amunt valencia), learning how to cook and mostly eating, watching movies and rating them with my friends, going on walks, and probably a few other things. 
        </p>
