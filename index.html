        <p>Hi! My name is Pablo Carbajo Derennes.</p>
        <p> 
            I am currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Data Science and Economics. I am currently passionate about financial markets and how different mathematical tools can be used to better interpret and take advantage of the market. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Other passions that I enjoy reading about in my free time include Blockchain Technology and specifically De-Fi. Most recently, I've been interested in seeing how the De-Fi space is evolving into an intent-centric technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. Currently, I enjoy playing (since I am 7 y/o) and watching soccer (amunt valencia), learning how to cook and mostly eating, watching movies and rating them with my friends, going on walks, and probably a few other things. 
        </p>
