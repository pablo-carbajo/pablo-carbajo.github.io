        <p>Hi! My name is Pablo Carbajo Derennes.</p>
        <p> 
            I am currently a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, studying Data Science and Economics. I am currently passionate about financial markets and how different mathematical tools and qualitative dataa can be used to better interpret the direction of the market.

            In my free time, I enjoy reading about Blockchain Technology and the different applications it has in the real world. Recently, I have taken an interest in De-Fi, and I'm fascinated by how the De-Fi space is evolving into an intent-centric technology. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. Currently, I enjoy playing (since the age of 5) and watching soccer (amunt valencia), learning how to cook and mostly eating, watching movies and rating them with my friends, going on walks, and probably a few other things.
